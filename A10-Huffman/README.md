## Assignment Reflection

Please reflect on your experience with this assignment. What was most challenging? What was most interesting?  What did you learn that you might use again?
Most challenging was decodeding and figuring out why my decoded message was 300 lines of zeros. I would say trying to figure out how to use old code and adapt it to work for this new assignment was the most interesting and something I'll use again. The satisfaction of getting the message decoded was amazing!
