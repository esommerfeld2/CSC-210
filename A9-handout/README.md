## Assignment Reflection

Please reflect on your experience with this assignment. What was most challenging? What was most interesting?  What did you learn that you might use again?
This was hard one. I was really confused about the doublely linked lists and arrays versus the tree. Particulary the idea of doing it all in place, without a copy. I spent hours upon hours trying to figure out each method so I would cut down this assignment in the future. I am glad I did it; I learned a lot but it was quiet diffcult to get through (more step by step instructions to lead me in the right direction would have been useful). I feel more comfortable using a tree structure so that might be something I use again!
