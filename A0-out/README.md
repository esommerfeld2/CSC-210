Reflection on your experience with this assignment:
This was hard. I have been working all summer in R using coding in a very different way. Coming back to java is difficult espically since I never fully felt like I got my feet under me in this language. I tired my best but I am very interested in getting feedback to better understand how I am doing and what this assingment really wanted from me.
