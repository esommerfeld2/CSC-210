## Reflection

Reflection on your experience with this assignment:
This was a really fun assignment! I was a little confused on how I was supposed to start everything but once I got going I really enjoyed it. It was a fun problem to try to solve and while I know my code isn't 100% efficent it was fun to problem solve.

Any questions you still have?
The last phase was a little confusing but I think I got it. So as of now I'm good. But the recursion that we have been talking about in class... I think I will have many questions.
