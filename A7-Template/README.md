# A7 DIY SpellChecker

Your readme should include the following information. **Each student needs to submit all of this information themselves, even when pair programming.**

## General Information

Programming Partner Name (if you'd like to be graded together): N/A

Other Collaborators (and kudos to helpful members of the class): N/A

Any references used besides JavaDoc and course materials: Generative AI the way I always use it: which this time was to remind me of syntax and catch my dumb errors (aka for loops need for(int i = 0; i < array.length; i++) not just for (int i = 0; array.length; i++)).

## Assignment Reflection

Please reflect on your experience with this assignment. What was most challenging? What was most interesting?
I struggled with underestanding how to ignore punctuation and it had been a long time since I worked with a scanner. However I enjoyed learning about HashSets and I really liked working with them. The problem solving that went into the five different cases of a spelling error was fun. Overall good assignmnet!
