Reflection on your experience with this assignment:
I struggled so much. I spent hours upon hours combing through methods and my code is still not my best, it is still messy and there is so much I want to change. I ran out of time. That being said hopefully A2 comes out on time and I will have 2 additional days to work through it. I did take an extension on this assignment but aside from figuring out why I am failing the test section w/ the autograder I feel decent about this assignment.
