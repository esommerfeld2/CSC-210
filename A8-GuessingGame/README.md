## Assignment Reflection

Please reflect on your experience with this assignment. What was most challenging? What was most interesting?

The most challenging part was figuring out how to build the tree when the computer didn't guess the users animal. I spent a lot more time on this assginment than usual puzzling that question out. It was really interesting to work with trees and to read and write the files: hard but interesting.
