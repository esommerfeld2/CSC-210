# A8 Card Sorting

Your readme should include the following information. Each student needs to submit all of this information themselves, even when pair programming.

Generative AI as always to walk me through in words (no code) ideas and poke flaws in my pseudo code. 
## Assignment Reflection

What did you notice about the differences in runtime across algorithms as you changed the number of cards you were sorting? If you had to split them into "slower" algorithms vs "faster" algorithms, which would you put in each category?
Quickly selection sort and insertion sort starting taking longer. Meanwhile merge and quick sort were faster. So that would be my two categories. Overall selection was the slowest, then insertion, quick, and finally merge was the fastest. Quick and merge were by far faster than selection and insertion and it was only when I increased the card count up to large values (100,000) that I started seeing significant differences. 

Please reflect on your experience with this assignment. What was most challenging? What was most interesting?
I really enjoyed this assignment. The graphics were really helpful to visulaize. In my insertion sort (if I remember correctly) I had buggy code that made cards dispear and on one occasion having every card turn to the 2 of clubs and just having a final list of all 2 of clubs. Then that helped me look back at my code and be like why am I changing every card into the 2 of clubs? Finally recurssion is still something I am trying to grasp so quick sort was hard to implement. But I loved the challenge!
