# A7 Linked Lists

Your readme should include the following information. **Each student** needs to submit all of this information, even when pair programming.

AI, see below.

If you used AI, please describe how and the interaction between AI and your understanding of this assignment and specifically the related data structures and algorithms:
AI helped me find smaller bugs in my program and helped me understand what was going on when everything appeared to be going well (ie my print statements looked as I would expect but my tests were still failing). It also helped me with syntax because it had been forever since I had written a while loop for example. 

## Reflection

What do you see as the benefits and downsides of working with linked lists instead of arrays? When might they be most useful versus limiting?
Linked lists are great if you want to add or remove things easily and care about order. They are not great when you need to access a specfic element. If things were constantly moving and you needed to keep track of it but you rarely needed to access those elements a linked list would be great. If you need to access an element fast and aren't moving things around a ton an array is better.

What was the major challenge you faced in completing this assignment?
I struggled a lot with the phase two implementation, writing while loops ane understanding how to remove/add things without loosing my list and dealing with null and all the edge cases too.

What do you feel you learned from this assignment?
I learned a lot about linked lists and how they can be used. What methods were more lengthly to write and complicated so maybe a linked list will be slow or not great in that area. I learned more about thinking through rarer cases and how to code them. Ie what if afterHere is null how do I start at the begining of the list versus the midddle. I was writing a lot of if statements so keeping track of that was also something I was learning how to do.
