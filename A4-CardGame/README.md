# A7 Linked Lists

Your readme should include the following information. **Each student** needs to submit all of this information, even when pair programming. 

## Submission Details

Your Name:
Ella Sommerfeld

Programming Partner Name (if you are submitting identical code):
None

Other Collaborators (submitting related but non-identical code):
None

Kudos/shout-out to particularly helpful members of the class or teaching staff:
None

Any references used besides JavaDoc and course materials:
None besides AI see below.

If you used AI, please describe how and the interaction between AI and your understanding of this assignment and specifically the related data structures and algorithms:
As always AI helped me debug my code and in this assignment explain existing code and how the mouse worked and clicking inforamtion was stored! I had it explain an iterator to me again and ran through fake examples with ABCDE to make sure I was fully understanding how it worked behind the scenes!

## Reflection

In what ways were the use of linked lists particularly appropriate for this assignment?
Linked lists were partiularly appropriate for this assignment because our primary goal was to move things around. By that I mean append and insert. Our goal was never to access specfic elements which linked lists are not good at. But linked list are great for adding and removing elements which is what we needed to do.

What was the major challenge you faced in completing this assignment?
The major challenge was understanding how mouse clicking worked. I did not understand the x and y thing for a while and when I needed to call it. But eventually I figured it out. I would say also creating the iterator was a challenge. 

What do you feel you learned from this assignment?
I learned how to create an iterator and when it is useful. I also understood how it was acessing elements and the idea of skipping over elements and order. I feel like I have a lot better handle on this concept after this assignment.
