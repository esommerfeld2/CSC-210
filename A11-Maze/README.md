## README Basics 
Your README should include the following information. Each student needs to submit all of this information themselves, even when pair programming. 

Programming Partner Name:

Any references used besides JavaDoc and course materials:
AI (below)
Describe any use of AI on this assignment and what it taught you:
I really struggled with Phase 4 so AI helped me break down the task and think through it. As always I ask AI to not write any code just walk me through the ideas/ re explain the instructions so I know what I am doing/trying to do.
## Reflection

Do you have any remaining questions about this assignment?
Phase 4 is still confusing to me but I finished it so I guess I don't have any lingering questions.
In phase four, what method did you choose to store the extra data?  Why did you make this choice?
I chose arrays and I chose this because I did not fully understand how to use a hash table for two values. Plus I appericated that the array was similar in space to the Maze with locations. 
Reflection on your experience with this assignment:
I liked this assignmnet but given the end of the semester I was quiet stressed trying to finish all the phases. Doing the rescursive solving was really hard and by the time I got the phase 4 I had spent a lot of time on this assignment. Either putting this assingmnet earlier in the semester or shortening it would probably be helpful for future CSC students!
